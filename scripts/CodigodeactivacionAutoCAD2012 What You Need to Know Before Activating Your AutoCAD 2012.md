### Drawing and modifying objects

- Array command is now associative. You can create rectangular, polar, or path arrays that are linked to the original objects. You can also edit the array properties and items easily.
- Multifunctional grips are improved for more objects. You can use the grips to manipulate objects such as lines, arcs, dimensions, leaders, mleaders, polylines, and more.
- We also can ânudgeâ selected objects to move it a few pixels or by grid snap definition. You can use the arrow keys to nudge objects in different directions.
- Group is now easier to manage. You can create and edit groups from the ribbon or the context menu. You can also select group members by using filters.
- We also have new value in these system variables: PICKADD and PICKAUTO. They control how objects are added to selection sets and how commands are repeated automatically.
- There is also enhancement in SNAPMODE. You can now use geometric center snap to locate the center of closed polylines, regions, and circles.
- NCOPY and OVERKILL are now part of AutoCAD native tools. NCOPY allows you to copy objects from nested blocks or xrefs. OVERKILL allows you to delete duplicate or overlapping objects.

### Explore and share

- AutoCAD 2012 also provides AutoCAD WS integration, so you can share your drawings and collaborate with your partners. You can upload your drawings to AutoCAD WS online service and access them from any web browser or mobile device.
- Content explorer is pretty much like design centerâ¦ with muscle. There are more capabilities here, includes setup the content explorer service to manage the data properly and quickly. You can use content explorer to find and insert blocks, layers, styles, xrefs, and other drawing contents from local or network folders.
- Autodesk Inventor Fusion is included in AutoCAD 2012 installation. You can use it to create and edit 3D models using direct and parametric modeling techniques. You can also exchange data between AutoCAD and Inventor Fusion seamlessly.
- Model documentation is a new feature that allows you to create 2D drawing views from 3D models. You can create base, projected, section, detail, and auxiliary views from AutoCAD or Inventor models. The views are associative and update automatically when the model changes.

### Help documentation

- AutoCAD 2012 has improved its help documentation with more contents and better navigation. You can access the help online or offline. You can also download updates for the help files periodically.
- The help system also provides contextual tips and videos for some commands and options. You can see them on the command line or on the dynamic input tooltip.
- You can also use Autodesk Exchange to access online resources such as tutorials, videos, blogs, forums, apps, and more. You can customize your Autodesk Exchange page with your favorite contents.
