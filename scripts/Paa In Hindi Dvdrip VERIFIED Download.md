Paa is not just a movie, but a social message that raises awareness about progeria and the challenges faced by the people who suffer from it. Progeria is a rare and fatal genetic condition that affects about one in four million newborns worldwide. It causes premature aging and leads to various health complications, such as cardiovascular disease, stroke and arthritis. The average life expectancy of a person with progeria is 13 years.
 
The movie Paa was inspired by the real-life story of Sam Berns, an American teenager who had progeria and became a motivational speaker and an activist. Sam was also featured in a documentary called Life According to Sam, which was produced by HBO. Sam passed away in 2014 at the age of 17.
 
Paa also highlights the importance of family support and acceptance for people with progeria and other disabilities. The movie shows how Vidya loves Auro unconditionally and does everything to make him happy and comfortable. She also encourages him to pursue his hobbies and interests, such as painting, music and astronomy. She does not let his condition define him or limit him. Similarly, Amol learns to accept Auro as his son and becomes a caring and responsible father. He also uses his political influence to spread awareness about progeria and to raise funds for research and treatment.
 
Paa is a movie that will inspire you to live life to the fullest and to appreciate the people who love you. It will also make you empathize with the people who are different from you and who face difficulties in their lives. Paa is a movie that will stay with you long after you watch it.
